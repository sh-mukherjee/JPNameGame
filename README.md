# Two-Character Japanese Family Names
## Choose any two rows from the table below using the checkboxes. If you combine the two characters, do you get a family name that is among the top 1000 family names in Japan? Hit the Submit button and find out! 

(Sometimes you may be asked to try again even though you chose two kanji that do make up a legitimate family name -- it may just not be among the top 1000 family names.)

The selection table was created as follows:
1. Take all the two-character family names from [The 1,000 most common Japanese family names](https://jref.com/articles/common-japanese-surnames.213/)
2. Take all the characters in this set of names
3. From this set of characters, take all the characters which are also in the [List of jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)
4. Source their meanings from the same [List of jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)

NOTE: The [List of jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji) may not have all the meanings for kanji with multiple meanings, so the above selection table may have meanings that are not very apt in the context of a family name.
