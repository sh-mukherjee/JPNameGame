The kanji selection lists in the sidebar were created as follows:
1. Take all the two-character family names from [The 1,000 most common Japanese family names](https://jref.com/articles/common-japanese-surnames.213/)
2. Take all the characters in this set of names
3. From this set of characters, take all the characters which are also in the [List of jōyō kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)
